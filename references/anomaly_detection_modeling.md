# Anomaly Detection Modeling

In this project, isolation forest, one class SVM and local outlier factor are respectively used to conduct anomaly detection on the CPU utilization data.

For each model, the input dataset has been standardized using StandardScaler on the below attributes:
- value
- hours
- daylight
- day of the week
- is week day or not

The models predict anomalies on the dataset, and a scattered chart is plotted for each model on all the normal data points and anomaly data points, with X-axis being the date, and Y-axis being the CPU utilization value.

Besides, a histogram is plotted to visualize the frequency distribution of normal value data and anomaly value data, so that it could be observed in which distribution bins do the anomalies come from.

It could be observed that anomalies generated by isolation forest are mainly distributed in higher value bins. Anomalies by one class SVM scatter across all value bins rather evenly, and those generated by local outlier factor tend to gather around lower value bins.
